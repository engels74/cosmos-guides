# 04b) Check if pt-wings work

In this section, we'll verify that our config.yml works as expected. Then we'll connect our 'pt-wings' container to the 'pterodactyl\_nw' network we created in our config file.

### Restarting the `pt-wings`

1. Finally, we can restart our pt-wings container:

1. We should now examine the container's logs. To do so, navigate to the Logs menu in the pt-wings container's Details.
2. Something along the lines of this should be there:

```log

```

3. Go to the **Network** tab of the `pt-wings`: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/t8T5r9G.png" alt="" data-size="line">
4. Find the `pterodactyl_nw` network and select **Connect**.

### Check if the reverse proxy work

1. To see if the `pt-wings` reverse proxying is working as intended, load up your `https://pterodactylnode.domain.com` site up in a new tab in your browser.
2. In my case, that would be `https://pterodactylnode.engels.zip`.
3. It should give you this message:

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json"><strong>"The required authorization heads were not present in the request."
</strong></code></pre>

4. Oddly enough, this means that it's working as intended.

### On to the next step!
