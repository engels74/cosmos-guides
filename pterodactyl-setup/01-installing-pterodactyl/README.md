### Installing Pterodactyl

Basically, what I'm going to guide you through is:

1. Creating the docker-compose file for Pterodactyl, and editing the right parts of it
2. Launching the docker-compose file, and then making work properly with Cosmos
3. Creating 2 reverse proxied URLs (https)
4. Initial setup of the Pterodactyl Panel
5. Initial setup of the Pterodactyl Wings
6. Creating the `config.yml` for the Wings
7. Connecting the Wings to the Panel
