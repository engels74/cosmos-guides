# Cosmos Guides

## Welcome!

I made this Gitbook tutorial site because I needed a place to write detailed tutorials for Azukaar's "Cosmos Server" project.

This was originally intended to only hold a tutorial for installing Pterodactyl Panel and Wings, but it may be expanded if I discover other software that requires additional explanation.

## Index of the Guides:

### Docker & Cosmos setup

#### [Docker & Compose Setup](broken-reference)

#### [Cosmos Server Setup](broken-reference)

###

### PterodactylÂ®

#### [Pterodactyl Setup](broken-reference) (in Cosmos)

#### [Using Pterodactyl](broken-reference)
