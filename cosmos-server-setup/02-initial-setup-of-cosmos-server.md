Now that we've got it up and running, we should configure Cosmos. It's fairly straightforward.

### Setup Cosmos

1. Mark the checkbox for "Clean Install"
2. Select "**Next**"

4. Select "**Next**"
5. For the next part, it'll check if you have a `mariadb` server setup.\
   Whether or not you have one, I recommend just letting Cosmos take care of it.
6. Select `"Automatically create a secure database"` and press Connect:

7. It should now show, that the database is connected:
