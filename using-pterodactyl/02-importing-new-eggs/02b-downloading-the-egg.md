# 02b) Downloading the egg

### Downloading eggs

1. Now that we've found our [V Rising egg](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/game\_eggs/steamcmd\_servers/v\_rising/v\_rising\_vanilla), I'll show you how to download it.
2. All egg's come in `.json` format. So find the `.json` file of the egg.
3. In this case, that would be `egg-v-rising.json`.
4. Click on it!

1. Find the little <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mwAwbTL.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon. That will download the `.json` file locally to your PC.
2. If it doesn't show up, you might need to login to Github.
3. If you don't have a Github login, you can also find the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/27KNGQY.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon, right click and select "**Save Link As.."** and save it somewhere on your PC.
