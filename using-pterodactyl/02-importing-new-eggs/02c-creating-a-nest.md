# 02c) Creating a Nest

In true Pterodactyl fashion, we remain in bird terminology. We need a place to store our newly downloaded egg. Eggs are found inside "nests," which are simply groups or categories of eggs.

1. Head to your Pterodactyl Panel, and go into **Settings** (<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JjwmnYO.png" alt="" data-size="line">).
2. Find the **Nests** menu and head into it: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uONZqY1.png" alt="" data-size="line">
3. Select **Create New** to begin creating a new Nest: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/twxhn3F.png" alt="" data-size="line">
4. You can give it any name you want. However, because I'm importing a SteamCMD-based game server, I'll call mine **SteamCMD**. I don't need a description, so I'll leave that field empty.
5. Select **Save** to save the Nest.
