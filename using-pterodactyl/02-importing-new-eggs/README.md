# 02) Importing new eggs

## Disclaimer

As previously described, "eggs" in Pterodactyl terms are basically the game servers themselves. They are a lot ready-to-go eggs.

They're mostly located at this Github Repository:

Most of the eggs work out-of-the-box with Pterodactyl, while some needs minor adjustsments. Usually it's because the Windows based game server tools need Wine to run it, and while Pterodactyl takes care of the Wine part automatically, it might still end acting weird and needing a few tweaks here and there.

But if that's the case, it'll be quite clear from the individual egg's README file. But, enough disclaimers. Let's get to it.

### On to the next step!
