# 03b) Game server configuration

Because the previous tutorial covered how to set up a server already, I'll refer you to these pages if you need more information:

* [Core Details](../../01-setting-up-a-game-server/01a-creating-a-server/01aa-core-details.md)
* [Allocation Management](../../01-setting-up-a-game-server/01a-creating-a-server/01ab-allocation-management.md)
* [Application Feature Limits](../../01-setting-up-a-game-server/01a-creating-a-server/01ac-application-feature-limits.md)
* [Resource Management](../../01-setting-up-a-game-server/01a-creating-a-server/01ad-resource-management.md)

I'll proceed from the "**Allocation Management**" section of the server creation process, as that is where it may differ from the previous step in the tutorial.

After that, we'll go straight to "**Nest Configuration**" and then to **Service Variables**.

### On to the next step!
