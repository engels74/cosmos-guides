# 03bb) Nest Configuration

### Game server configuration

#### Nest Configuration

The Nest Configuration is where you specify _what_ type of game server you want to create. In this case, I'll use the `SteamCMD` we just created, as my Nest and `V Rising` as my Egg.

Do **not** set a checkmark in the "**Skip Egg Install Script**", as we need to install the server, since it's the first time we launch a SteamCMD/Valheim server.

#### Docker Configuration

Most custom eggs, especially SteamCMD-based eggs, will have only one option here. They may not all be the same because some are customized for that particular egg.
