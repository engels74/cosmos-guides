# 01cb) Accessing the SFTP server

Since we're already in the console view, I'll quickly demonstrate how to connect to the SFTP.

On my Windows machine, I use WinSCP as my primary SFTP client. So I'll use that for this tutorial. It serves my purposes well, so I have no experience with other programs, possibly with the exception of Transit5 for macOS. That also worked well for me.

1. While in the Pterodactyl Console view, find the **Settings** menu: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tqc8bqd.png" alt="" data-size="original">
2. Find the **Launch SFTP** and select it: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uwrnpfE.png" alt="" data-size="line">
3. If your SFTP Client supports it, your browser will display a popup asking if you want to use that client to launch the SFTP link.
4. You should obviously answer **YES** so that we can examine the SFTP server.
5. It'll ask for a password - it's the same password you use for logging into the Pterodactyl Panel.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The SFTP password** is linked to the user who has been designated as the server owner. This goes for each server created.
