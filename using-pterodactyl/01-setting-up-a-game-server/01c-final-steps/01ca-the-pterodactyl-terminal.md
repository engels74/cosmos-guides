# 01ca) The Pterodactyl Terminal

There isn't much to say here except that this is where the server installation progress is displayed and where you can connect to the SFTP server that will be created for you.

1. To get to your server's terminal, go to **Servers** in your Panel
2. Select the server you need to go into. In my case, that would be my `Minecraft (Paper)` server.
3. Select the little ![](https://i.imgur.com/hbSpVNq.png) icon, and you'll get shown to your server's console.
4. When your server is running, the console will _usually_ say something along the lines of:

```log
container@pterodactyl~ Server marked as running...
```
