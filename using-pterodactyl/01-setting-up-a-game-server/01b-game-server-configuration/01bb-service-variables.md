### Service Variables

Typically, this is where you configure particular game server settings. There are more options for some eggs than others.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is also where you would need to change the Steam Query port for Steam-based (SteamCMD) servers, to the one you designated in "**Additional Allocation(s)**".
{% endhint %}

But for this Minecraft server, there are very few options in the setup panel itself.

You can change the:

* `Minecraft Version`
* `Server Jar File`
* `Download Path` if you want to download a different `server.jar`
* `Build Number` for PaperMC releases.
