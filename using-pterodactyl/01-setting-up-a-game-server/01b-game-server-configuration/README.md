# 01b) Game server configuration

#### Nest Configuration

The Nest Configuration is where you specify _what_ type of game server you want to create. In this case, I'll use `Minecraft` as my Nest and `Paper` as my Egg.

Do **not** set a checkmark in the "Skip Egg Install Script", as we need to install the server, since it's the first time we launch a Minecraft/Paper server.

#### Docker Configuration

Here you can choose the Java version. For this tutorial, I'm going to keep it on Java 17.
