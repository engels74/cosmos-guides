# 01) Setting up a game server

Pterodactyl comes with a few game servers (eggs) right out of the box. There are several Minecraft servers, Source Engine servers, Voice Servers, and a Rust server among them.

There are numerous Pterodactyl game servers available. The majority of these are available at this repository:

I'll show you how to import these later in the tutorial. But for the time being, we'll try to set up a simple Minecraft server so you can get a feel for how Pterodactyl works.

It becomes somewhat easier to set up a few different servers.
