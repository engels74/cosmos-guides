# 01aa) Core Details

#### Core Details

1. You can enter whatever you want for **Server Name**, but I recommend naming it something relevant to the server you're creating. Because that's what I want to make, I'll call mine `Minecraft (Paper)`.
2. You can leave the **Server Description** blank, or write something there if you need to.
3. You need to select a **Server Owner**. In my case, that would be me, the admin user. I'll search for my email, `engels74@tuta.io` and it should find my user.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Only** the "Server Name" and "Server Owner" fields require you to enter information.
{% endhint %}
